    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 pinch white sugar</li>
        <li>¼ cup flour for dusting</li>
        <li>2 cups pizza sauce</li>
        <li>20 slices fresh mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <dl style="width: 50%;">
        <dt><b>step 1</b></dt>
        <dd>Stir flour and 1 teaspoon salt in a bowl. Set aside.</dd>
        <dt><b>step 2</b></dt>
        <dd>Mix water, yeast, and sugar in a large bowl. Let stand
             until yeast begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 minutes.</dd>
        <dt><b>step 3</b></dt>
        <dd>Stir half the flour mixture into yeast mixture until no dry spots
             remain. Stir in remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, mixing well 
             after each addition. When dough pulls together, turn it out onto
              a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, 
              about 8 minutes.</dd>
        <dt><b>step 4</b></dt>
        <dd>Lightly oil a large bowl, then place dough in the bowl and turn to 
            coat with oil. Cover with a light cloth and let rise in a warm place 
            (80 to 95 degrees F (27 to 35 degrees C)) until doubled in volume, 
            about 1 hour. Punch dough down, divide into 4 equal pieces, and form 
            each into a ball.</dd>
        <dt><b>step 5</b></dt>
        <dd>Preheat oven with a pizza stone to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).</dd>
